# js-jeopardy

This is a Jeopardy app we are going to use for a company event.  It was not 
developed by me -- I only added stuff to it and made it look like real Jeopardy.

I may refactor this code later and release it with instuctions (since it does
look kind of cool right now) -- but it would have to be modified to use an
updated version of jQuery (or just plain JS) as well as use modern programming 
methodologies.
